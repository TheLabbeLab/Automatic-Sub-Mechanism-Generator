The code generates the Sub Mechanism automatically. The code works with the output file of Master Equation System Solver (MESS) Code. User needs to provide information of Temeprature, Pressures and Species iformation in YAML file, for which the reaction rates are generated by MESS.The inputeed pressure values should for reaction mechanism to generated ratehr than the pressrues at which MESS solved reaction rates. The code needs to inititalized from Terminal which will initiate the UI of the code within Terminal from where user can have option to select the reaction routes for which the rates are need to be fitted.
